Reflection:
    Overall, as a team we have successfully worked together on iteration 1. 

Highlights: 
    - The three meetings were productive and thoughtful, which enables more discussion towards controversial problems. (e.g. how to determine a user's permission in a channel)
    - Pair programming was implemented so that each person can take a turn and improve quality of code. 
    - Our understanding of the project was consistently improving by discussing and expaining to each other.
     
Improvements: 
    - Have the same level of understanding of specifications before starting on workload. 
    - Can have more standups to know our current situation and keep everything up to date.

Meeting outcomes: 
    - Meeting 1: 
        * Clarified the functions and what we needed to do within the specs. 
        * Determined how to share the workload to optimise productivity. 
        * Cleared up misunderstanding of how the functions should be written. 
    - Meeting 2: 
        * Worked together to do auth.py and auth_test.py to ensure that we were all on the same page. 
        * Split remaining workload and helped each other if there were more misunderstandings. 
    - Meeting 3: 
        * Determined that we have been overengineering the stub functions and that we should
        mainly focus on the tests. 
        * Cleared up assumptions for the definition of token and how it can be used in determining the permissions within a channel.
